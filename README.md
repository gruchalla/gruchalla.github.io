A minimalist Jekyll-based research vanity site with Jekyll collections for paper and video publications.

The collections are specified in `_config.yml`

```
collections:
- papers
- videos
```
and created from the files in `_papers` and `_videos`. 


To build the site on a local preview server:

```
~/gruchalla.github.io> jekyll serve
```
