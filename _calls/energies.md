 Special Issue of Energies (ISSN 1996-1073; CODEN: ENERGA) on "Energy Data Visualization". Energy applications are gaining wider attention in the visualization community as data dealing with energy problems become more accessible. Computational models, networks of sensors, and operational data are just a few examples of data sources, and these data target varying aspects of the energy sector, including generation, costs, demand, and security. In addition, the tasks and goals demanded on the data range from basic understanding to analysis, operational management, and predictive planning. Thus, the broad span of data sources, range of purpose, and the variety of users makes visualization in the energy domain quite challenging.

In this Special Issue, we are soliciting visualization work that targets the challenges for visualization encountered in the energy domain. The goal of this Issue is to bring together visualization work from disparate energy fields and highlight research that may be beneficial across the confluence of visualization and the energy sector.
