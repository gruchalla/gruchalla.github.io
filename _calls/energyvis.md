We are interested in bringing together multidisciplinary perspectives, especially on the human-centric component of energy visualizations. We are accepting ​Short papers​, up to 4 pages in 9-point ACM double-column format (i.e., excluding references) and unlimited number of pages for appendices and references, single-blind. We invite innovative ideas, design concepts, requirement analysis and work-in-progress relating to the following technical scope: energy visualization contexts, energy visualization challenges​, disruptive technologies​, data concepts, human interaction & user-centric design.
