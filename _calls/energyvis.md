We are excited to announce the call for papers for the 3rd Workshop on Energy Data Visualization, EnergyVis 2023, to be held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS conference in Melbourne, Australia October 2023. Like IEEE VIS 2023, EnergyVis will be an "in-person first" event.
 
We are accepting short papers, up to four pages plus up to one page of references. Submissions will be in the VGTC conference two-column format, in line with the IEEE VIS formatting guidelines. We invite innovative ideas, design concepts, requirement analysis and work-in-progress relating to the following technical scope:
- **Energy visualization contexts:** smart cities/homes/buildings/grid, network visualizations, energy policy and governance, net zero initiatives, energy consumers and analysis, energy markets, microgrids/nanogrids, personal energy analytics
- **Energy visualization challenges:** uncertainty visualization, spatio-temporal visualization, large network visualization, micro/macro scale, automated model comprehension
- **Disruptive technologies:** open source, open analytics and open workflows, machine learning, AI, VR/XR, tangible interfaces,
- **Data concepts:** big data, real-time data challenges, open data portals, open standards, forecasting and predictions, quantified self, citizen science
- **Human interaction & user-centric design:** human factors, cognitive load, persuasive methods, co-creation design methods, visualization for decision support and decision making, evaluation methods, stakeholder & requirement analysis, visualizations for experts vs. general public, energy games and gamification
