image_text: "A simulated image of the situated visualization of photovoltaic module performance, mimicking the view of the augmented reality projection. In this figure, a simulation has been run; power flow across the cells are shown as arrows and pipes. Shaded cells are highlighted in yellow. As a portion of the module is in shadow, diodes have bypassed certain cells; these are marked by spheres. Note the optical tracking marker in the foreground, used to relay physical panel orientation to the rest of the system."

The rapid growth of the solar energy industry requires advanced educational tools to train the next generation of engineers and technicians. We present a novel system for situated visualization of photovoltaic (PV) module performance, leveraging a combination of PV simulation, sun-sky position, and head-mounted augmented reality (AR). Our system is guided by four principles of development: simplicity, adaptability, collaboration, and maintainability, realized in six components. Users interactively manipulate a physical module's orientation and shading referents with immediate feedback on the module's performance.
