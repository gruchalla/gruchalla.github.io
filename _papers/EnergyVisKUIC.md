image_text: "The figure visualizes the Kaua`i transmission system during an oscillation event after a generator trip. Left:  time-series plots showcase the behavior of per unit voltage (v), frequency (f), reactive power (Q), and real power (P) of the generators over time. Middle: oscillatory-trajectory curves illustrate the relationships among the time-series waveforms. Each generator plots in a unique color, and the black lines represent the network connections between generators. Right: a geographical plot emphasizes the spatial distribution of generators within the system. The generators are sized proportionally based on their real power output and colored by their frequencies. The comprehensive view of the Kaua`i transmission system during an oscillation event, combining time-series plots, oscillatory-trajectory curves, and a geographical representation, help understand and illustrate the forces driving the oscillation."

In this work, we discuss the design of visualizations for understanding the complex oscillatory dynamics of an island power system with renewable generation sources after the loss of a large oil power plant. %
As more renewable generation sources are added to power systems, the oscillatory dynamics will change, which requires new visualization techniques to determine causes and strategies to avoid unwanted behaviors in the future.
Our approach integrates geographic views, time-series plots, and novel oscillatory-trajectory curves, providing unique insights into the interdependent oscillatory behaviors of multiple state variables and generators over time. By enabling multi-node and multivariate comparisons over time, users can qualitatively determine drivers of oscillations and differences in generator dynamics, which is not possible with other commonly used visualization techniques.
