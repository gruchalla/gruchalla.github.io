Duke Energy, Alstom Grid (now GE Grid Solutions), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) collaborated to better understand advanced inverter and distribution management system (DMS) control options for large (1–5 MW) distributed solar photovoltaics (PV) and their impacts on distribution system operations. The specific goal of the project was to compare the operational—specifically, voltage regulation—impacts of three methods of managing voltage variations resulting from such PV systems: active power, local autonomous inverter control, and integrated volt/VAR control. The project found that all tested configurations of DMS-controlled IVVC provided improved performance and provided operational cost savings compared to the baseline and local control modes. Specifically, IVVC combined with PV at a 0.95 PF proved the technically most effective voltage management scheme for the system studied. This configuration substantially reduced both utility regulation equipment operations and observed voltage challenges.
