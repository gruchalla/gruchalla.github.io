Our ability to generate data from simulations and experimental platforms is generally outpacing our ability to analyze those data efficiently and effectively. There are a growing number and variety of possible visualization display modalities, from commodity head-mounted displays to large-scale immersive environments, from desktop and touch displays to high-resolution display walls. Many of these visualization technologies and visual environments are rapidly evolving and could transform analysis for certain classes of complex scientific and engineering data. However, the choice of what technology or combination of technologies to use has historically been largely ad hoc and lacks a carefully validated understanding of how to best utilize different visualization technologies to advance the science. To maximize the impact of our data and analyses, it is imperative that we use the most effective visualization environments for the analysis task at hand.
