We have developed a framework for the exploration, design, and planning of energy systems that combines interactive visualization with machine-learning based approximations of simulations through a general purpose dataflow API. Our system provides a visual interface allowing users to explore an ensemble of energy simulations representing a subset of the complex input parameter space, and spawn new simulations to “fill in” input regions corresponding to new energy system scenarios. Unfortunately, many energy simulations are far too slow to provide interactive responses. To support interactive feedback, we are developing reduced-form models via machine learning techniques, which provide statistically sound estimates of the full simulations at a fraction of the computational cost and which are used as proxies for the full-form models. Fast computation and an agile dataflow enhance the engagement with energy simulations, and allows researchers to better allocate computational resources to capture informative relationships within the system and provide a low-cost method for validating and quality-checking large-scale modeling efforts.
