The transportation sector accounts for almost a third of the United Statesâ€™ energy consumption. We are developing predictive simulations of the complex in-cylinder processes of internal combustion engines to improve performance and decrease pollutant emissions. We provide a first look at the jet impingement and ignition inside a piston-cylinder chamber using volume rendering. Through the visualization, constructed a complete 3D picture of the jet impingement on the piston-bowl walls leading to the formation of pockets of auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture. These auto-ignition pockets subsequently lead to flame stabilization releasing the chemical energy for conversion to useful work. A detailed physical picture of flame stabilization, as provided by the visualization techniques presented in this study help, in the design of next-generation internal combustion engines.
