The goal of the ExaWind project is to enable predictive simulations of wind farms comprised of many megawatt- scale turbines situated in complex terrain. Predictive simulations will require computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for which the mesh resolves the geometry of the turbines and captures the rotation and large deflec- tions of blades. Whereas such simulations for a single turbine are arguably petascale class, multi-turbine wind farm simulations will require exascale-class resources. We describe efforts to establish a body-resolved model of a megawatt-scale turbine that will be used for demonstrating and testing our wind farm simulation platform. The team chose the NREL 5-megawatt (MW) wind turbine, which is a notional turbine that is fully defined in the open domain. Given many proprietary issues surrounding modern turbines in the field (e.g., turbine control system, blade geometry and materials), a refer- ence turbine such as the NREL 5-MW is ideal for the benchmarking and demonstration studies that will be key to the success of the ExaWind project. This milestone was designed to demonstrate a working model that will be used for figure-of-merit measurements and will establish baseline results that will be improved upon as the project progresses.
