Immersive virtual environments are becoming increasingly common, driving the need to develop new 
software or adapt existing software to these environments. We discuss some of the issues and limitations of 
porting an existing molecular graphics system, PyMOL, into an immersive virtual environment. Presenting 
macromolecules inside an interactive immersive virtual environment may provide unique insights into 
molecular structure and improve the rational design of drugs that target a specific molecule. PyMOL was 
successfully extended to render molecular structures immersively; however, elements of the legacy 
interactive design did not scale well into three-dimensions. Achieving an interactive frame rate for large 
macromolecules was also an issue. The immersive system was developed and evaluated on both a shared-memory 
parallel machine and a commodity cluster.
