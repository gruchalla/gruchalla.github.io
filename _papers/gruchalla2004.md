The benefits of immersive visualization are primarily anecdotal; there 
have been few controlled users studies that have attempted to quantify the added 
value of immersion for problems requiring the manipulation of virtual objects. This 
research quantifies the added value of immersion for a real-world industrial problem: 
oil well path planning.  An experiment was designed to compare human performance 
between an immersive virtual environment (IVE) and a desktop workstation with 
stereoscopic display. This work consisted of building a cross-environment 
application, capable of visualizing and editing a planned well path within an existing 
oilfield, and conducting an user study on that application. This work presents the 
results of sixteen participants who planned the paths of four oil wells. Each 
participant planned two well paths on a desktop workstation with a stereoscopic 
display and two well paths in a CAVE-like IVE.  Fifteen of the participants 
completed well path editing tasks faster in the IVE than in the desktop environment, 
which is statistically significant (p < 0.001).  The increased speed in the IVE was 
complimented by an increase correct solutions. There was a statistically significant 
(p < 0.05) increase in correct solutions in the IVE. The results suggest that an IVE 
allows for faster and more accurate problem solving in a complex interactive three-dimensional domain.
