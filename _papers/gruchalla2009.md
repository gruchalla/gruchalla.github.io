One of the barriers to visualization-enabled scientiﬁc discovery is the difficulty 
in clearly and quantitatively articulating the meaning of a visualization, particularly 
in the exploration of relationships between multiple variables in large-scale data sets. 
This issue becomes more complicated in the visualization of three-dimensional turbulence, 
since geometry, topology, and statistics play complicated, intertwined roles in the 
deﬁnitions of the features of interest, making them difficult or impossible to precisely 
describe. 
This dissertation develops and evaluates a novel interactive multivariate volume 
visualization framework that allows features to be progressively isolated and deﬁned 
using a combination of global and feature-local properties. I argue that a progressive 
and interactive multivariate feature-local approach is advantageous when investigating 
ill-deﬁned features because it provides a physically meaningful, quantitatively rich environment
within which to examine the sensitivity of the structure properties to the 
identiﬁcation parameters. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the analysis 
of vortical structures in Taylor-Green turbulence. Through this analysis, two distinct 
structure populations have been discovered in these data: structures with minimal and 
maximal local absolute helicity distributions. These populations cannot be distinguished 
via global distributions; however, they were readily identiﬁed by this approach, since 
their feature-local statistics are distinctive.
