Knowledge extraction from data volumes of ever increasing size
requires ever more flexible tools to facilitate interactive query. 
Interactivity enables real-time hypothesis testing and scientific
discovery, but can generally not be achieved without some level of 
data reduction. The approach described in this paper combines
multi-resolution access, region-of-interest extraction, and structure
identification in order to provide interactive spatial and statistical
analysis of a terascale data volume.  Unique aspects of our
approach include the incorporation of both local and global statistics of
the flow structures, and iterative refinement facilities, 
which combine geometry, topology, and
statistics to allow the user to effectively tailor the analysis and
visualization to the science.  Working together, these facilities
allow a user to focus the spatial scale and domain of the analysis and
perform an appropriately tailored multivariate visualization of the
corresponding data.  All of these ideas and algorithms are
instantiated in a deployed visualization and analysis tool called
VAPOR, which is in routine use by scientists internationally.  In data
from a 1024x1024x1024 simulation of a forced turbulent flow, VAPOR allowed
us to perform a visual data exploration of the flow properties at
interactive speeds, leading to the discovery of novel scientific
properties of the flow. This kind of intelligent,
focused analysis/refinement approach will become even more important
as computational science moves towards petascale applications.
