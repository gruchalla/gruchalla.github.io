As the U.S. works to meet emissions reduction goals and modernize power sector operations, residential buildings—which account for 21% of the total U.S. electricity consumption—will play a key role. While the bulk power system is becoming increasingly renewable, residential sector efficiency improvements, on-site renewable generation, storage, and other Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) technologies will all contribute substantially towards achieving climate goals while maintaining reliable grid operations. The value provided by residential buildings is distributed across multiple stakeholders, including homeowners and occupants, utilities, grid operators, distributed energy resource aggregators, and society at large. However, different value streams are relevant to each stakeholder, resulting in technology valuations and deployments that often lack a holistic quantification of impacts or equitable distribution of benefits.   We analyze field data from a deployment of S+S in a community of highly efficient homes. We use this data to quantify value streams of the existing S+S across stakeholders and use modeled results to show how additional value could be derived from these systems. As a unique contribution of this report, we additionally demonstrate how GEB these value streams can be visualized and communicated across stakeholders using a novel scorecard.
