Supersonic  combustion has received considerable interest in recent years due to emphasis on hypersonic vehicle development, reusable launch systems and air-breathing rocket engines.  Combustion and flame stabilization at high supersonic flows is challenging mainly because of extremely small residence times for fuel-oxidizermixing  and  ignition.   Cavity-based  flameholders  are  aviable technique for providing flame-stabilization in theseapplications.  The cavity geometry enables flow deceleration and recirculation thus increasing the residence timefor adequate mixing and combustion.  Flameholderbehavior varies based on whether fuel is injected upstreamof or within the cavity, with both general strategies having been explored in laboratory-scale systems.  Injectionupstream of the cavity is a practical solution that providesfuel for flameholding and main engine combustion, butmay require high fueling rates for greater mixing withinthe recirculation zone.  Direct fuel injection within thecavity on the other hand provides greater control of localstoichiometry and fuel residence times; however, a theoretical understanding of how turbulent mixing betweenthe  fuel  jet  and  air  stream  influences  combustion  hasnot yet been fully developed.  The main contribution ofthis work is to address these interactions via high-fidelity combustion simulations.  Our simulations, along with the help of cutting-edge visualization, provide deeper insights on fuel-jet shear-layer interactions within a cavity flame-holder when the injection location is varied, which in turnwill enable optimized direct fuel injection strategies.
