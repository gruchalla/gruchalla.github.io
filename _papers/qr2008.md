We studied the added value in using immersive visualization as a molecular 
research tool. We present our results in the context of "embodied cognition", 
as a way to understand situations in which immersive virtual visualization may 
be particularly useful. PYMOL, 
a non-immersive application used by biochemistry
researchers, was ported to an immersive virtual environment (IVE) to run on a 
four-PC cluster. Three research groups were invited to extend their current 
research on a molecule of interest to include an investigation of that molecule
inside the IVE. The groups each had a similar experience of visualizing a 
feature of their molecule they had not previously appreciated from workstation 
viewing; large-scale spatial features, such as pockets and ridges, were readily
identified when walking around the molecule displayed at human scale. We 
suggest that this added value arises because an IVE affords the opportunity to 
visualize the molecule using normal, everyday-world perceptual abilities that 
have been tuned and practiced from birth. This work also suggests that short 
sessions of IVE viewing can valuably augment extensive, non-IVE based 
visualizations.
