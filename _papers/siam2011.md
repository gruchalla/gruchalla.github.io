The High-Performance Systems Biology Toolkit (HiPer SBTK) is a collection of simulation and optimization 
components for metabolic modeling and the means to assemble them into large parallel processing hierarchies suiting a particular simulation optimization need. The components come in a variety of different categories: model translation, model simulation, parameter sampling, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and optimization. They can be conﬁgured at runtime into hierarchically parallel arrangements to perform nested combinations of simulation characterization tasks with excellent parallel scaling to thousands of processors. We describe the observations that led to the system, the components, and how one can arrange them. We show nearly 90% efficient scaling to over 13,000 processors, and we demonstrate three complex yet typical examples that have run on ∼1000 processors and accomplished billions of stiff ordinary differential equation simulations.
