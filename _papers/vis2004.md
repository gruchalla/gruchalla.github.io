In this paper, we describe an immersive prototype application, AtmosV, 
developed to interactively visualize the large multivariate atmospheric
dataset provided by the IEEE Visualization 2004 Contest committee.  The 
visualization approach is a combination of volume and polygonal rendering. 
The immersive application was developed and evaluated on both a shared-memory 
parallel machine and a commodity cluster. Using the cluster we were able to 
visualize multiple variables at interactive frame rates.
