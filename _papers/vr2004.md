The benefits of immersive visualization are primarily anecdotal; there
have been few controlled user studies that have attempted to quantify
the added value of immersion for problems requiring the manipulation of
virtual objects. This research quantifies the added value of immersion
for a real-world industrial problem: oil well-path planning. An
experiment was designed to compare human performance between an
immersive virtual environment (IVE) and a desktop workstation. This
work presents the results of sixteen participants who planned the paths
of four oil wells. Each participant planned two well-paths on a desktop
workstation with a stereoscopic display and two well-paths in a
CAVE-like IVE. Fifteen of the participants completed well-path editing
tasks faster in the IVE than in the desktop environment. The increased
speed was complimented by a statistically significant increase in
correct solutions in the IVE. The results suggest that an IVE can allow
for faster and more accurate problem solving in a complex
three-dimensional domain.
