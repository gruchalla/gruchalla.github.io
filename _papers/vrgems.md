In our daily usage of the large-scale immersive virtual reality (VR) environment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), we have observed how immersive VR can be a useful tool to enhance some scientific and engineering workflows. Improved spatial judgments, 3D interaction, extra degrees of freedom, and new opportunities for collaboration are just a few of the benefits offered by immersive VR. On multiple occasions, we have observed scientists and engineers discover features in their data using immersive VR that they had not seen in prior investigations of the data on traditional desktop displays. We have embedded more information into our analytics tools, allowing engineers to explore complex multivariate spaces. In this chapter, we discuss these practical advantages of immersive VR in the context of several real-world examples.
