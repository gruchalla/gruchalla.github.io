In this paper, data from a lidar-based field campaign are used to examine the effect of yaw misalignment on the shape of a wind turbine wake. Prior investigation in wind tunnel research and high-fidelity computer simulation show that the shape assumes an increasingly curled shape as the wake propagates downstream, because of the presence of two counter-rotating vortices. The shape of the wake observed in the field data diverges from predictions of wake shape, and a lidar model is simulated within a large-eddy simulation of the wind turbine in the atmospheric boundary layer to understand the discrepancy.
