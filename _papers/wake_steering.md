In this paper, we investigate the role of flow structures generated in wind farm control through yaw misalignment. A pair of counter-rotating vortices are shown to be important in deforming the shape of the wake and in explaining the asymmetry of wake steering in oppositely signed yaw angles. We motivate the development of new physics for control-oriented engineering models of wind farm control, which include the effects of these large-scale flow structures. Such a new model would improve the predictability of control-oriented models. Results presented in this paper indicate that wind farm control strategies, based on new control-oriented models with new physics, that target total flow control over wake redirection may be different, and perhaps more effective, than current approaches. We propose that wind farm control and wake steering should be thought of as the generation of large-scale flow structures, which will aid in the improved performance of wind farms.
