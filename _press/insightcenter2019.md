As more and more data are generated, scientific visualization is becoming increasingly important to energy research. NREL data scientist Kenny Gruchalla designed and built a visualization cave inside NRELâ€™s Energy Systems Integration Facility to help researchers explore their data in new ways and understand their research from new perspectives. This capability is helping move the needle on high-impact projects dealing with complex, large-scale data.
