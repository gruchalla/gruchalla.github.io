In a scramjet engine, supersonic flows and short residence times make combustion challenging. Cavity flame holders are necessary to achieve adequate mixing and flame stabilization. We perform high-fidelity combustion simulations to understand direct fuel injection effects. Air flows in at Mach 1.5, at a temperature of 1000K and 1 atm of pressure. We explore two hydrogen fuel injection strategies: floor injection near the step, and floor injection near the ramp. The reacting flow solver, PeleC, drives the simulation on the Eagle HPC at NREL. Adaptive mesh refinement provides higher resolutions and reduces compute resource requirements. Near-step injection provides higher peak temperatures and richer combustion with heat-release and pressure variation correlated in time. While the near-ramp injection has greater fuel mixing and lower peak temperatures. Identification of these important physical phenomena in flame-holder mechanisms will pave the way to efficient direct fuel injection strategies.
