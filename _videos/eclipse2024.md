With support from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office, and in collaboration with the North American Electric Reliability Corp., NREL has studied the extent of reduction in solar generation during the eclipse, across the country. The visualization shows the clear-sky impacts to utility-scale PV (yellow) and distribution PV (orange).
