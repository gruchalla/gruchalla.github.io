Geometry-resolved large-eddy simulation of the NREL 5MW wind turbine, which shows velocity isosurfaces at 5.5 m/s after three rotor revolutions.  Simulation was performed on the NERSC Cori system with Nalu-Wind, which is an unstructured-grid, low-Mach-Number computational fluid dynamics code (CFD).  Code development and simulations are being performed as part of the DOE ExaWind Exascale Computing Project (ECP) and the DOE EERE Wind Energy Technologies Office High-Fidelity Modeling project
