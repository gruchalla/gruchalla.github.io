A detailed numerical simulation of a turbulent liquid 
jet. Atomization of liquid fuel is the process by which a coherent 
liquid flow disintegrates in droplets. Understanding atomization will 
have far reaching repercussions on many aspects of the combustion 
process. This was a large-scale scaling study run on Red Mesa, , 
involving 1.36 billion cells, run on 12,228 cores, rendered on 1,248.
