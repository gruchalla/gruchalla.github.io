Wind-plant operators would like to better control wind turbines to mitigate the wake effects between turbines, as the wakes that form behind upstream wind turbines can have significant impacts on the performance of downstream turbines. However, in order to make sound adjustments, operators need data charting the relationship between the degree of the adjustment and the resulting wake deflection. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, which can be programmed to measure atmospheric velocity, may be able to generate enough data to make such adjustments feasible in real-time. However, LiDAR only provides a low spatial and temporal fidelity measurement, and how accurately that measurement represents a turbine wake has not been established. To better understand the efficacy of using LiDAR to measure the wake trailing a wind turbine, we have used high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate a wind turbine in turbulent flow, and simulate LiDAR measurements in this high-fidelity flow. A visual analysis of the LiDAR measurement in the context of the high-fidelity wake clearly illustrates the limitations of the LiDAR resolution and contributes to the overall comprehension of LiDAR operation.
