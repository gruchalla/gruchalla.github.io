Fluidized bed reactors are a promising technology for 
the thermo-chemical conversion of biomass in biofuel production. 
However, the current understanding of the behavior of the materials in a
 fluidized bed is limited. We are using high-fidelity simulations to 
better understand the mechanics of the conversion processes. This video 
visualizes a simulation of a periodic bed of sand fluidized by a gas 
stream injected at the bottom. A Lagrangian approach describes the solid
 phase, in which particles with a soft-sphere collision model are 
individually tracked along the reactor. A large-scale point-particle 
direct numerical simulation involving 12 millions particles and 4 
million mesh points has been performed, requiring 512 cores for 4 days. 
The onset of fluidization is characterized by the formation of several 
large bubbles that rise and burst at the surface and is followed by a 
pseudo-steady turbulent motion showing intense bubble activity.
