As the United States moves toward utilizing more of 
its wind and water resources for electrical power generation, 
computational modeling will play an increasingly important role in 
improving the performance, decreasing costs, and accelerating deployment
 of wind and water power technologies. We are developing computational 
models to better understand the wake effects of wind and marine 
hydrokinetic turbines, which operate on the same principles. Large wind 
plants are consistently found to perform below expectations. Inadequate 
accounting various turbulent-wake effects is believed to be in part 
responsible for the under-performance.
