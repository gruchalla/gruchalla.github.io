The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Computer Graphics Forum, which has been an annual event since the mid-1970s, is a venue where government-sponsored computer graphics/scientific visualization scientists, engineers, and practitioners have the opportunity to share recent research, development, and deployment results. While the participants are primarily from DOE laboratories and DOE-funded universities, the forum has welcomed participants who are funded by other government agencies (e.g., Department of Defense, National Science Foundation) to perform graphics and visualization work.
While there are other venues for presenting and discussing graphics/visualization research, such as Siggraph and IEEE Visualization, the DOE labs, with their emphasis on extreme-scale computation, face unique challenges in visualization and data understanding. Thus, over the years, the forum has proven invaluable for sharing information and experiences, building cross-institutional collaborations, and coordinating efforts across programs.
