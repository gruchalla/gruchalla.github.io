In conjunction with [ACM e-Energy 2021](https://energy.acm.org/conferences/eenergy/2021/), (Torino, Italy) this workshop brings together scientists, researchers and practitioners from the field to discuss the many challenges and goals in regard to energy data visualization. This topic will build on the findings of the first workshop. 

Recent years have seen substantial technological and analytical enhancements to the energy sector, enabling the move away from a passive and inefficient power grid network to the delivery of a smart system via sensors, monitors and other digital technologies. In parallel, we have seen advanced data analytics emerging (and being presented at core venues such as e-Energy) to explore improvements to predictions, forecasts and models throughout the industry. The emerging data from this sector is not only growing in volume but in its complexity.

Visualization as a tool for data analysis, exploration and communication has become a driving force in the task of unravelling data complexity and is crucial in helping to bridge the gap between the flood of data and ensuring decision makers can make more effective and informed decisions. Visualization and visual analytics offer a vast array of opportunities for the energy domain and we have seen a new era of ‘Energy Data Visualization’ emerge as a topic of growing importance.
