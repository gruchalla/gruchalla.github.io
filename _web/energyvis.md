In conjunction with <a href="https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome">IEEE VIS 2024</a>, in St. Pete Beach, FL, USA.
The energy sector is witnessing significant technological progress, primarily driven by the
							growth of renewable energy, distributed energy resources, and smart grid technologies. This
							rapid evolution is generating increasingly large, complex data that present substantial
							challenges for energy systems planning and operations. For example, previously, distribution
							feeders had only a handful of sensors and controllable devices; now, with these new
							technologies, thousands or even tens of thousands of such devices are possible. As a result,
							energy system models have grown exponentially in planning scenarios from just hundreds of
							components to millions. Moreover, the adoption of distributed solar generation and
							grid-aware devices such as smart thermostats and electric vehicles are expanding the breadth
							of stakeholders, including consumers, engineers, regulators, urban planners, and
							policymakers, who are trying to understand these energy systems. These new energy systems
							are generating vast amounts of complex data, which require visualization techniques capable
							of handling the sheer scale and multifaceted complexity of the information. Unfortunately,
							much of the visualization supporting these changes is outdated, with simple one-line
							diagrams and contour plots being over-extended by the data they are being applied to. More
							research is needed to develop new and innovative visualization methods that can handle the
							increasing complexity of energy systems and provide a diversity of stakeholders with the
							necessary insights to make informed decisions about the future of energy.
                            The EnergyVis 2024 workshop aims to bring together scientists, researchers, and practitioners
							from the energy and visualization domains to critically assess and discuss energy data
							visualization in the context of the evolving energy sector. . This yearâ€™s workshop will be theme around decision support.
