In conjunction with [IEEE VIS 2023](https://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome), Melbourne, Australia.
The energy sector is witnessing significant technological progress, primarily driven by the
                                                       growth of renewable energy, distributed energy resources, and smart grid technologies. This
                                                        rapid evolution is generating increasingly large, complex data that present substantial
                                                        challenges for energy systems planning and operations. For example, previously, distribution
                                                        feeders had only a handful of sensors and controllable devices; now, with these new
                                                        technologies, thousands or even tens of thousands of such devices are possible. As a result,
                                                        energy system models have grown exponentially in planning scenarios from just hundreds of
                                                        components to millions. Moreover, the adoption of distributed solar generation and
                                                        grid-aware devices such as smart thermostats and electric vehicles are expanding the breadth
                                                        of stakeholders, including consumers, engineers, regulators, urban planners, and
                                                        policymakers, who are trying to understand these energy systems. These new energy systems
                                                        are generating vast amounts of complex data, which require visualization techniques capable
                                                        of handling the sheer scale and multifaceted complexity of the information. Unfortunately,
                                                        much of the visualization supporting these changes is outdated, with simple one-line
                                                        diagrams and contour plots being over-extended by the data they are being applied to. More
                                                        research is needed to develop new and innovative visualization methods that can handle the
                                                        increasing complexity of energy systems and provide a diversity of stakeholders with the
                                                        necessary insights to make informed decisions about the future of energy.</p>
The EnergyVis 2023 workshop aims to bring together scientists, researchers, and practitioners from the energy and visualization domains to critically assess and discuss energy data visualization in the context of the evolving energy sector.
