HPG2024 will be co-hosted with [SIGGRAPH](https://s2024.siggraph.org) in Denver, Colorado on Friday July 26 through Sunday July 28. High-Performance Graphics (HPG) is the leading international forum for performance-oriented graphics and imaging systems research, including innovative algorithms, efficient implementations, languages, compilers, parallelism, and hardware architectures for high-performance graphics. The conference brings together researchers, engineers, and architects to discuss the complex interactions of parallel and custom hardware, novel programming models, and efficient algorithms in the design of systems for current and future graphics and visual computing applications.

We are pleased to announce the [Call for Participation](https://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2024/call-for-participation/) in the HPG2024 conference.
