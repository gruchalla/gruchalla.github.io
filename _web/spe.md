Understanding the coadsorption of two species on a surface requires the exploration of phase diagrams. To facilitate exploration this web tool creates interactive and downloadable phase diagrams from ab initio data. With SPE it is possible to create surface ab initio phase diagrams for single species adsorbing to a surface as well as coadsorption of two species to a surface, and visualize the Wulff Construction of the surface at any temperature and pressure. Explore the entire temperature and pressure range for all adsorbates using interactive and downloadable charts.
